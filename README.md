# lib_mcp342x
Microchip mcp3425/6 library.

16-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converter with
 I2C Interface and On-Board Refer

Currently initialize and one shot convert with
the hardcoded setup.

## Depends on a I2C library.

The I2C files are from:
https://github.com/erossi/avrlib_i2c

## Missing part
 * API Doxygen doc
 * test with an arduino
 * schema of a demo circuit in kicad with arduino
 * proper Makefile
